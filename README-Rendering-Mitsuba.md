# Scene Rendering Project with Mitsuba

This project allows rendering 3D scenes from a JSON file using Mitsuba, a physically-based renderer, along with Python libraries for data manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Mitsuba**: A renderer that must be installed and configured on your machine.
- **Python >= 3.8**: Ensure that Python version 3.8 or higher is installed. You can check your Python version using the following command in your terminal:

  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

- **pip**: The package manager for Python. It is typically installed with Python.

## Installing Python Dependencies

The required Python dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Content of `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following lines:

```txt
mitsuba
numpy
matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the `render_scene.py` script, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python render_scene.py path_to_json_file
```

### Example

```sh
python render_scene.py scene.json
```

In this example, the `render_scene.py` script will read the `scene.json` file, process the data, and then use Mitsuba to render the specified scene.

## JSON Files

The JSON files used by this script are automatically generated by the **Export** button in the C++ application **Ecoviz**. When you use the export feature in Ecoviz, it creates a JSON file that contains all the necessary parameters for rendering the scene with Mitsuba.

## Project Structure

- `render_scene.py`: The main script that handles rendering the scene using Mitsuba.
- `scene.json`: An example JSON file that defines the parameters of the 3D scene to render.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of the required Python dependencies.

## Mitsuba

Mitsuba must be properly installed and configured to work with this project. You can follow the installation instructions for Mitsuba on [the official Mitsuba website](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/).
