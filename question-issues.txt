Q: the same data seems to be replicated for each 3D render view - all trees (so 4x the underlying data?)

Q: scaling bug with trees on terrain (Additional scale factor in x/y?)

Q: basal  area info not displaying  - is this loaded, computed?

Q: antialiasing not working - for FBO need special mode, but even in transect view. investigate

Q: recursive paint calls when locking transect view (sometimes) - some paint calls are nested? should not call paint directly, but signal?

Q: low res window for transect? Needs anti-aliasing

Q: normal map not working when lock transect called - even when restored, radiance scaling is then off in main wndow
